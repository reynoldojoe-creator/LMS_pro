This book is an in-depth review of prosthodontic
procedures as they are applied in the maxillofacial 
situation. The subspecialty of maxillofacial prosthetics 
is frequently practiced by prosthodontists and 
occasionally by general dentists in a hospital 
environment who have not had the benefit of formal 
training in the subspecialty. It is hoped that this book 
will be of use to those individuals by serving as a 
“how-to” 
reference 
emphasizing 
prosthodontic 
procedures 
while 
minimizing 
surgical/medical 
considerations that can more appropriately be found 
elsewhere. To that end, Clinical Maxillofacial 
Prosthetics is written as a user’s guide to commonly 
occurring maxillofacial prosthetic challenges. This 
approach is based upon careful discussion of both 
general and specific prosthodontic principles and tech-
niques rather than on numerous case reports of limited 
value to the general

These 
concerns,

philosophies and methods, and the challenge of
practicing maxillofacial prosthetics in private practice 
as well as in institutional environs were the impetus 
for creating this book. A conscious decision was made 
to focus on the “how to” rather than the historical 
basis for treatment or the medical background of 
involved disease processes. 
A number of excellent texts have been written on 
the subject of maxillofacial prosthetics. By review of 
my own library, at least nine full texts have been 
dedicated to the subject in the past 50 years. They 
have addressed the subspecialty and have to a greater 
or lesser degree also dealt with the medical 
management of patients whose circumstances require 
maxillofacial prosthetic care. The drawback of this 
approach has been a tendency to oversimplify 
medical/surgical treatment or to narrowly focus on the 
therapeutic philosophy and protocol of specific 
medical centers without add

principles for the management of the many patients 
needing our services. The ranks of those providing 
traditional maxillofacial prosthetic services have 
expanded to include prosthodontists, general and 
hospital dentists, and others not formally trained in the 
subspecialty. The practice of maxillofacial prosthetics 
has also been dramatically impacted by third parties
not directly involved with the provision of patient care 
but whose activities dramatically affect our ability to 
treat.

 considering the maxillofacial complex 
as an integrated system, it is clear that disruption of 
any of its components has an effect on all of the
remaining components. Physiologic deficits are easily 
understood since there are outward signs of the 
deficit, but patient comfort is not easily perceived by 
an observer. When treating patients with maxillofacial 
defects, it is prudent for the clinician to anticipate 
altered sensations that may be difficult to overcome 
with conventional prosthetic methods. Patients should 
be provided with prostheses that are comfortable and 
do not cause tissue irritation. Retention that is 
dependent upon frictional contact can result in 
irritation that may cause alteration in the residual 
anatomy.

 Prosthetics 
The prosthodontist assumes responsibility for the 
fabrication of prostheses that provide function, 
esthetics, and comfort. As defects increase in size or 
as the number of involved structures increase, the task 
of the prosthodontist increases in complexity (Zarb, 
1967; Parr et al, 1989). Optimal care is provided if 
residual anatomy is used appropriately. 
Primary Factors that Affect 
Prosthetic Success 
All prostheses must resist a variety of forces that may 
displace the prosthesis and generate stress to the 
residual structures of the orofacial complex. Forces 
may be directed toward, away from, or at an angle to 
the supporting structure. Prosthesis success is often 
dependent upon the use of methods of compensation 
for diminished anatomic capacity for support, 
retention, and stability of a prosthesis. 
In order to achieve a favorable level of retention, 
remaining teeth and the remaining soft and hard 
tissues must be used to the optimal degree. It is 
prudent

er 
than 
rendering 
the 
patient 
edentulous. Although some teeth may not be 
adequately positioned to retain a conventional partial 
denture obturator prosthesis, they can become suitable 
overdenture abutments to be used in a coping/magnet 
system (Fig 6-25). Mandibular teeth should also be 
maintained so the patient is not functioning with a 
complete mandibular denture as well as an unstable 
obturator 
prosthesis. 
Finally, 
no 
matter 
what 
additional retentive elements may be employed, sound 
prosthodontic principles of using bony' undercuts,
achieving 
maximum 
tissue 
coverage 
without 
overextension, and placing the dentition in harmony
with the functional tissues are paramount for 
prosthetic success when treating the edentulous 
maxillectomy patient.

must necessarily be provided in hospital settings, the 
technology and economic aspects of patient care have 
altered 
previous 
traditional 
approaches 
to 
its

change, the principles, concepts, and practices 
applicable to prosthodontic treatment still constitute 
the fundamental basis for sound maxillofacial pros-
thetic therapy. The underlying intent of this book, as 
succinctly expressed by the author in his preface, 
reflects cognizance of those factors and 
endeavors to facilitate their application by whomever 
and wherever the services are being provided. 
To enunciate the scope of prosthodontic pro-

Foreword
Following World War II, an era of specialization
among health care professionals ensued. In dentistry, 
medicine, and surgery, specialists were trained to 
keep pace with the rapidly growing body of 
knowledge that evolved from new developments in 
diagnosis, 
treatment 
methods, 
instrumentation, 
materials, and technology. As a subspecialty area of 
the recognized dental specialty prosthodontics, 
maxillofacial prosthetics has become an essential 
patient-care link between dentistry and surgery. 
Because patient populations and life expectancy 
have increased, the need for maxillofacial prosthetic 
services has also grown. While much of this treatment 
must necessarily be provided in hospital settings, the 
technology and economic aspects of patient care have 
altered

The drawback of this 
approach has been a tendency to oversimplify 
medical/surgical treatment or to narrowly focus on the 
therapeutic philosophy and protocol of specific 
medical centers without addressing the full extent of 
accepted treatment modalities and philosophies. 
Medical/surgical 
modalities for the treatment of congenital, devel-
opmental, 
and 
acquired 
maxillofacial 
defects 
frequently change so rapidly that the therapies 
described in texts on maxillofacial prosthetics are 
often outdated by the time the book is published. To 
address these problems, this book has been written 
with a focus on the prosthodontic aspects of care for 
our patient population. For a review of the etiology, 
pathology, or therapeutic management for a specific 
type of tumor or congenital defect, the reader is 
directed to books or journals that deal primarily with 
such procedures. 
This book is an in-depth review of prosthodontic
procedures as they are applied in the maxillofacial
